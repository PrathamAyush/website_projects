    <h4><u>History of <em>Patna</em></u></h4>
    <p>The history and tradition of Patna go back to the earliest dawn of civilization. The original name of Patna was
        <strong>Pataliputra</strong> or <strong>Patalipattan</strong> and its history makes a start from the
         <em>century 600 B.C</em>. The name Patna has undergone
        many changes at its earliest stages like Pataligram, Kusumpur, Patliputra, Azimabad etc., ultimately terminating
        to the present one. <mark>Chandragupta Maurya made it his capital in the 4th century B.C.</mark> 
        Thereafter the
        city lost its
        importance until Sherkhan Suri rose into power in the early 16th century A.D. Another version that comes to
        focus is that there existed a village named Pattan or Patthan, which later turned into Patna.It has been said
        that Pataliputra was founded by Ajatashatru. Patna, therefore, has become inextricably bound up with the ancient
        Pataliputra. The ancient village was named <strong>‘Patali’</strong> and the word <strong>‘Pattan’</strong> was
        added to it. Greek history
        mentions <strong>‘Palibothra’</strong> which perhaps is <u><em>Pataliputra itself</em></u>.
